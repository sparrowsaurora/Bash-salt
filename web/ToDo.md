# Web Side To Do

- make a features page to show off what each indiviual package can do? like a full page for each package
- add a commands page? for the preset commands <- potentially the package page "main"

- Redesign UI
- Add script install tool

DECISION:: static?

pros: easier hosting, free completely
cons: lacks strength on resume,

solution. temp static, convert to php microframework

### Note to Dev

deploy to vercel/github pages if static
